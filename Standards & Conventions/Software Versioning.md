## Proper Way to Do Software Versioning

**Software versioning** is the process of assigning unique identifiers to different releases or states of a software product, allowing developers and users to track changes, manage updates, and understand compatibility[^3][^6]. The proper approach depends on your project's nature, your users, and your release process, but several best practices and widely adopted schemes can guide you.

---

### Common Versioning Schemes

| Scheme | Format | Best For | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Semantic (SemVer) | MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | Libraries, APIs, projects with compatibility needs | 2.1.3 |
| Calendar (CalVer) | YYYY.MM or YY.MM | Products with scheduled releases, consumer apps | 2025.4 |
| Serial | Integer-only | Simple/internal tools, prototypes | 5 |
| Named | Name-based | Marketing, branding, consumer-facing products | "Big Sur" |


---

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

**Semantic Versioning** is the most widely recommended scheme for most software projects, especially those where backward compatibility and clear communication of changes are important[^1][^5][^6][^8]. The format is:

$$
\text{MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH}
$$

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes (breaking changes).
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible new features.
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

**Example:**
If you release a breaking change, go from 1.2.0 to 2.0.0. If you add a feature without breaking compatibility, go from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0. If you fix a bug, go from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1[^1][^6][^8].

SemVer can also include pre-release tags (e.g., 1.2.0-beta) and build metadata (e.g., 1.2.0+build123)[^6][^8].

### Other Schemes

- **Calendar Versioning (CalVer):** Use the release date as the version (e.g., 2025.4 for April 2025). This is common for products with regular, scheduled releases and is more meaningful to non-technical users[^5].
- **Serial Versioning:** Just increment an integer (1, 2, 3, ...). Useful for simple, internal, or rapidly evolving projects where compatibility is not a concern[^5].
- **Named Versions:** Assign memorable names to major releases (e.g., "Ubuntu Bionic Beaver"). Often used alongside numeric versions for branding[^5].

---

### Best Practices for Software Versioning

- **Choose a Clear and Consistent Scheme:** Pick a versioning scheme that fits your project's needs and stick to it[^2][^5].
- **Document Your Policy:** Clearly explain your versioning system in your documentation or README so users know what to expect[^1][^2].
- **Communicate Changes:** Maintain a changelog detailing what changed in each release[^5][^7].
- **Use Version Control:** Always use a version control system (like Git) to manage code and releases, tagging each release with its version number[^2][^10].
- **Automate Versioning:** Use tools to automate versioning and changelog generation where possible (e.g., semantic-release, standard-version)[^5].
- **Be Transparent and Consistent:** Publish a release schedule if possible and be consistent in how and when you increment versions[^1].
- **Solicit Feedback:** Engage users to ensure your versioning approach is clear and useful for them[^1].

### How to Choose the Right Scheme

- Use **SemVer** if:
    - You develop libraries, APIs, or tools where compatibility matters.
    - Your users are developers who need to know about breaking changes.
- Use **CalVer** if:
    - You release on a fixed schedule and users care about when, not what, changed.
    - Your audience is less technical or expects regular updates.
- Use **Serial/Named** if:
    - The software is simple, internal, or branding is a priority.

### Summary Table: When to Use Each Scheme

| Project Type | Recommended Scheme | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Public API/library | SemVer | Clear compatibility and breaking change signaling |
| Consumer app (fixed schedule) | CalVer | Users care about freshness, not technical details |
| Internal tool/prototype | Serial | Simplicity, low overhead |
| Major product releases | Named (+numeric) | Branding, marketing, memorable releases |


---

### Final Recommendation

For most software projects, especially those with external users or dependencies, **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** is the industry standard and provides the clearest communication about the nature of changes[^1][^5][^6][^8]. Always document your approach, tag releases in version control, and keep changelogs up to date for maximum clarity and reliability[^2][^5][^7][^10].
