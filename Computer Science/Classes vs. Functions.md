Here's the general rule of thumb:

<u>Use classes when...</u> you need something long lived and stateful that's easier to model if you could share behavior *and data structure* via [[Inheritance]], i.e. video games, simulations, GUIs

<u>Use functions when...</u> you're unsure if you need classes, or are just working with data transformations

***Use what feels right to you in your projects, and adjust and refactor as you improve your skills.***
