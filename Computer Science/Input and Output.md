In programming, the term <u>**I/O**</u> stands for input/output, and refers to anything that interacts with the outside world, such as:
- Reading from or writing to a file on the hard drive
- Accessing the internet
- Reading from or writing to a database
- Even simply printing to the console is consider I/O!
